This is an [Azure Function](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/functions/?WT.mc_id=javascript-0000-aapowell) that will generate images for my blog that are used as the Open Graph Image, when I haven't provided one directly.

Feel free to use it as a reference for doing it yourself, but you can't use the endpoint directly as it will check if the request is for a post on my blog (preventing the creation of random images!).
